# Roadmap

## Architecture decisions made

- Tracer based on the existing **Inspektor Gadget** gadgets (`trace_open`,
  `trace_tcpconnect`, ...) rather than an eBPF program written from
  scratch — greatly reduces failure risk for a team starting out with eBPF.
- Output in a **PodLock-compatible format** (`LandlockProfile` CRD,
  Kubewarden ecosystem) — the project is complementary, not a competitor.
- No automatic policy application: mandatory human review.

## Milestones

- [x] **M0 — Setup**: repo, license, GitHub Actions CI
      (`runs-on: ubuntu-24.04` to guarantee a kernel ≥ 6.8),
      `hack/check-kernel.sh` script, dev `kind` cluster — cluster + Inspektor
      Gadget deployed and verified working via `hack/init-vm.sh`
- [x] **⚠️ Hard checkpoint — week 3-4**: the tracer (Student A) must
      produce real events for at least one syscall type (e.g. `openat`),
      even minimal. **Cleared manually**: `kubectl gadget run trace_open:latest
      -n default -c nginx-demo` captures real `openat` events (confirmed
      `ls /etc` inside the container showing up live). This was done via the
      `kubectl gadget` CLI directly, not yet through `internal/tracer.Trace()`
      — the Go SDK integration is the remaining M1 work, but the fallback
      plan below is no longer needed: Inspektor Gadget works on this setup.
- [x] **M1**: tracer functional on `openat` (`connect`/`bind` descoped, see
      below — not a PodLock-representable output), `trace` CLI working end
      to end on a test pod (nginx)
      - [x] `trace` CLI wired up with `cobra` (`cmd/landlock-genprof/trace.go`):
        `Resolve()` → `Trace()` → `Synthesize()` → `ToProfile`/`ToYAML` →
        writing the output file.
      - [x] Manual proof that Inspektor Gadget captures real events on this
        cluster (see checkpoint above) — de-risked the actual SDK integration
      - [x] `internal/tracer.Trace()` implemented for `openat` (`trace_open`
        gadget) via the Inspektor Gadget Go SDK (gRPC runtime against the
        cluster's DaemonSet) — see `trace_linux.go` and
        `docs/architecture.md` §3 for the build-tag split (Linux-only, by
        necessity: the SDK doesn't compile on macOS/Windows)
      - [x] `trace_exec` gadget added alongside `trace_open` (run
        concurrently, merged into a single `[]Event`): `openat(2)` has no
        "exec" bit in its flags, so `trace_open` alone could never
        produce a `Mode: "exec"` event — found by trying to actually
        trigger a `readWriteExec` rule on the live cluster after the
        schema-alignment fix below, which exposed that `readExec`/
        `readWriteExec` had never been reachable from real data, only
        from hand-crafted test fixtures. See `docs/policy-synthesis.md`.
      - [x] ~~`connect`/`bind` (network) via `trace_tcpconnect`/`trace_bind`~~
        — **decided not to implement**: PodLock's real CRD schema
        (`github.com/flavio/podlock`) has no field to represent Landlock
        network rights at all, verified directly against its source
        rather than assumed. Capturing network events would produce data
        with nowhere to go in the output format. Revisit if/when PodLock
        adds network support upstream — see `docs/policy-synthesis.md`.
      - [x] **First full pipeline run validated on the live cluster**:
        `go run ./cmd/landlock-genprof trace --pod nginx-demo --binary
        /usr/sbin/nginx` against real activity (`kubectl exec nginx-demo --
        ls /etc`) produced a correct `profile.yaml` end to end. Surfaced
        and fixed a real bug in the process (directory-open aggregated to
        its own parent, producing `readOnly: [/]` — see
        `docs/policy-synthesis.md`), which no hand-crafted unit test had
        caught.
- [x] **M2**: policy synthesis (aggregation by directory, confidence
      levels), YAML export in PodLock format — `internal/policy.Synthesize`,
      `ToProfile`/`ToYAML` (see `docs/policy-synthesis.md`)
      - [x] **Architecture evolution — Behavior IR**: `Synthesize` used to
        return a PodLock-shaped `[]Rule` directly, coupling the
        observation/aggregation layer to one specific output format.
        Introduced `internal/profile` (a technology-neutral
        `BehaviorProfile`/`FilesystemProfile`/`FileAccess` IR, statically
        checked to have zero dependency on PodLock/YAML/Kubernetes — see
        `internal/profile/deps_test.go`) and isolated all PodLock-specific
        conversion in `internal/exporter/podlock`. `Synthesize` now
        produces the IR; the exporter alone decides how a permission set
        maps to PodLock's four joint categories. Prepares the ground for
        future exporters (Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`, Cilium, `seccomp`,
        ...) without having implemented any of them — no network
        collector was added, network tracing stays out of scope (see
        M1 above). See `docs/architecture.md` §3 and
        `docs/policy-synthesis.md`.
- [x] **M3**: full K8s integration (target pod resolution, tracer's
      minimal RBAC — see `docs/threat-model.md`)
      - [x] `internal/k8s.Resolve`: checks that the pod exists, is
        `Running`, and that the target container exists (or is deduced if
        there's only one) — tested with client-go's `fake` clientset, no
        real cluster
      - [x] Tracer's actual minimal RBAC (ServiceAccount/Role/RoleBinding) —
        [`deploy/rbac.yaml`](../deploy/rbac.yaml), each rule traced back
        to a specific API call in the code (not "grant broadly to be
        safe") — see `docs/threat-model.md` §1. Applied to the live
        cluster and verified with `kubectl auth can-i --as=...`: all 6
        checks (3 positive, 3 negative) match the manifest exactly —
        including confirming `pods/portforward` needs
        `--subresource=portforward` in `can-i`, not the `pods/portforward`
        slash form, which is a `kubectl auth can-i` CLI quirk, not a gap
        in the Role itself.
      - [x] Full functional test of `trace` using *only* this restricted
        ServiceAccount's token (`kubectl create token` + a scoped
        kubeconfig, no admin access): the full pipeline ran without a
        single permission error. **M3 complete.**
- [ ] **M4**: e2e demo on `kind` — profile generated for nginx, compared
      against a hand-written profile, gaps documented
- [ ] **M5 (stretch)**: post-deployment drift detection (Landlock denial
      logs → suggested policy adjustment)

## Fallback plan if the M0→M1 checkpoint fails

If the eBPF tracer (even via Inspektor Gadget) isn't working by the week
3-4 checkpoint: switch event capture to `strace -f` with output parsing.
Less elegant, but sufficient for a one-off training run (no production
performance constraint), and it lets Students B and C keep moving without
blocking on Student A.

## Task assignment

| Role | Component | Student |
|---|---|---|
| eBPF tracer | `internal/tracer/` | Student A |
| CLI + K8s integration | `cmd/`, `internal/k8s/`, `internal/policy/` | Student B |
| Methodology / security | `docs/threat-model.md`, adversarial tests | Student C |
